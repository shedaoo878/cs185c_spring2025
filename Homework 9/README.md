The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of greenhouse gas effects on the rapid melting of seea ice in the artic regions of the earth. One of the speculated impacts of this rapid warming scenario is the melting resulting in the emergence of a new "Transpolar" sea route, which would cut costs of transporting goods from nation to nation several days, expediting transport times, costs, and much more. Due to this, the region is becoming an increasing focus of national security, as whicver nation controls the new sea route, will have large power over other countries who will inevitably use the route. 

This project will build a simulated model using mitgcm of the current artic, and by modeling the effect of greenhouse gases and global warming, over decades, will attempt to estimate approximately what year/decade the sea route may be able to finally be traversed.
